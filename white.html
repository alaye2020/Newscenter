                <br>
                <br>
                <p>By Julia Temple and Peyton Lofton — August 25, 2022

                <br>
                <p>Is the reconciliation bill, which can be found here, really a chance for America to Build Back Better, or is it a massive income transfer program to favored Democratic constituency groups?  Unfortunately, it appears to be the latter.

                    Since our inception, The New Center has offered several ambitious policy solutions to reckon with climate change, healthcare, education, and other priorities addressed in the reconciliation bill. But far too much of the bill appears to funnel money to organized groups and constituencies that have lobbied for years for more government largesse. Perhaps that is why 39% of Americans believe the Build Back Better Act will have a negative impact on their lives while only 34% think it will be positive.
                    
                    The bill does have some good ideas that will benefit a broad spectrum of Americans, but far too much of it just picks winners among favored Democratic groups or funds significant expansions of federal agencies.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The biggest winner is the climate lobby, which routinely donates tens of millions of dollars to Democratic campaigns. The Build Back Better Act hands the climate lobby $555 billion in subsidies in the name of combating climate change and adopting cleaner energy sources. In reality, the reconciliation bill will forcibly green the U.S. consumer, doing more to ensure Elon Musk stays the world’s richest person than actually fight climate change. Under this bill, Americans will drive a more expensive and less practical electric car subsidized by the government. They will continue to live in the same houses with new, government-subsidized power systems. Billions of dollars will go to Environmental Justice Block Grants doled out to the exclusively Democratic constituencies that qualify.

                        Any serious effort to combat climate change would begin with the recognition that the United States is responsible for just 14% of global CO2 emissions. The single biggest contribution we can make, then, is developing breakthrough energy technologies that are affordable and scalable enough for developing countries like India and China to embrace. Yet the Build Back Better Act is instead full of provisions like this:</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            On the positive side of the ledger, The Build Back Better Act does nearly double the budget of the Department of Energy’s Loan Program Office (LPO), a relatively successful project to give clean energy innovators access to capital. The LPO has kept pace with private lenders in terms of loan loss rates while also creating thousands of jobs and spurring technological progress. While it could use some reform to ensure it is funding earlier stage research and technologies—as opposed to picking commercial winners and losers—the LPO has carved out an important role in funding research and innovation that might be too risky or expensive for the private sector alone
                            
                            Many of the Build Back Better Act’s provisions also function as handouts to unions and labor, sometimes explicitly. And given the reliably Democratic history of American unions, it is not hard to understand why. Between 2019 and 2020, labor unions spent over $80 million on political campaigns, 88% of which went to Democrats.
                            
                            21002 provides $350 million to “rebuild” the National Labor Relations Board
                            21003 provides $321 million to “rebuild” the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission</p>
                            <br>
                            <p> A key group here is the teachers’ unions. The bill does little to change the failing education system. America’s K-12 students are ranked 38th in math and 24th in science globally, yet the bill mostly funds the hiring of tens of thousands of new potential members of teachers unions as well as raises for the over 125,000 unionized pre-school teachers and childcare workers.

                                23002 provides $18 billion for Universal Preschool, but $7.5 billion of it must be used for pay increases for those already working in Head Start
                                The bill also provides rewards to higher education. Professors and university administrators, who donated five times as much to President Biden than to former President Trump in their 2020 campaigns, will receive sizable public grants:
                                
                                136601 gives $1 billion a year to higher education institutions (with a larger credit to minority-serving institutions) for creating environmental justice programs
                                Similarly, when it comes to healthcare, billions go to creating new potential members of the Services Employees International (SEIU,) the largest union of healthcare workers and an almost exclusively (97%) Democratic donor:</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>134101 establishes about $500 million in grants to create new healthcare workers from low-income communities
                                    134304 spends $50 million to improve staff-to-patient ratios in hospitals
                                    134201 provides $392 million to create additional nurses, with most of the funds going as wage subsidies or government-funded employee benefits
                                    31005/8 allocates $850 million for training nurses and creating a new health corps, while doctor training gets just $20 million
                                    The United Auto Workers (UAW), one of the largest unions in North America, also profits from this bill. Despite donating “only” 73% to Democrats in 2020, the UAW spent 99% of its contributions on Democrats in the previous 28 years.
                                    
                                    136401 provides households making up to $800,000 per year up to $12,500 in tax credits for electric vehicles, but only if those vehicles are brand new and produced by union workers
                                    80001/3 allocates $12 billion to the federal government for adding electric vehicles to existing fleets, including $7 billion for Postal Service vehicles
                                    In addition to unions, other reliably Democratic constituencies receive hefty rewards from this bill. From subsidizing electric bikes for well-off urbanites to prioritizing race-based over needs-based funding, the Build Back Better Act is often explicitly political in its choices. 
                                    
                                    Childcare benefits in the bill are weighted toward single mothers—who vote 8 to 1 Democratic—and against married couples and people who are working.
                                    
                                    Then there is Hawaii, which represents only 0.4% of the US population but is the third most Democratic leaning state in America. Hawaii receives more exclusively dedicated funding than the ten most populous states combined.
                                    
                                    </p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>31071 special funding of nearly $275 million to upgrade the healthcare system in one state — Hawaii
                                        70101/2 provides $500 million for tribal and Native Hawaii climate “resilience”
                                        70301/05 $181 million to save endangered species. And add $5 million to save endangered plants in Hawaii and $5 million to save “desert fish”
                                        40401 spends $1.6 billion to develop the Minority Business Development Agency
                                        31051 gives $50 million for substance abuse training fellows only in communities of color
                                        20006 allocates $200 million to preserve Native American Languages
                                        20025 provides $6 billion in scholarships only at pre-selected HBCUs
                                        12102 allocates over $1 billion in total to help provide financial assistance to people who have experienced discrimination in farm lending programs, including $10 million for “equity commissions”
                                        40001/40002 provides $90 billion for public and affordable housing
                                        11003 expends $4 billion to achieve “neighborhood equity” focusing on reconnecting divided communities
                                        136103 expands credits for “environmental justice” solar and wind energy projects only located in low-income areas
                                        50003 provides $100 million in new grants to non-profit community organizations fighting for greater security
                                        136406 provides up to $1,500 for electric bike owners, who earn above-average incomes and 33% of whom make over $100,000 per year
                                        As to more universal benefits, they are propped up by accounting gimmicks. The $400 billion in childcare and pre-school benefits is priced over ten years but expires in six. The increased child-care credit only lasts for one year. The expanded benefits to buy Affordable Care Act healthcare plans run out in 2025. If these provisions are indeed extended over the full ten years, the true cost of the bill is closer to $4 trillion than the stated $1.75 trillion.</p>
