                <p>In the 2020 U.S. presidential election, voter turnout was the highest it has been in a century, and 94% of Americans reported in a Pew Research Center survey that they found it “easy to vote.” This is not surprising; in response to the special challenges posed by the pandemic, many states adjusted their voting procedures to expand opportunities to vote by mail and made it easier to drop paper ballots in boxes outside densely populated polling places.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>Since 2020, many states have proposed—and some have enacted—laws that will change how many Americans register to vote and cast ballots.  

                    Critics of these changes charge that they would have a disproportionate impact on minorities and other groups that may find it more difficult to comply with new procedures or to get to the polls in person. Supporters of these new laws claim they are necessary to protect election integrity and to tighten up election procedures that were loosened too much amid the pandemic. </p>

                    <p>We won’t have definitive data on who is right until after the 2022 midterm elections. But here’s one thing that can be said for sure: Decades of data running through the 2020 election reveal that race is no longer the biggest determinant of who does and does not vote in America. Today, age, income, gender, and differences in enthusiasm that shift in every election play a much bigger role.

                        But is that trend likely to continue in future elections? That’s a question The New Center set out to explore. Below, we delve deeper into the voting patterns of various groups, drawing on two strands of evidence—analyses of voting trends prior to and including 2020, and research on the potential effects of new requirements.</p>
                        <br><br>
                        <p>Some critics of the state election bills passed by Republicans have described them as Jim Crow 2.0, and President Biden likened them to “Jim Crow on steroids.” 

                            They are essentially saying that the new proposals are somehow worse than the original “Jim Crow” era, which entailed poll taxes and literacy tests, violent intimidation of Black voters by the KKK, and even outright prohibitions on Black voters participating in party primaries in southern states. To suggest that any of the actual policy and procedural changes in new state voting measures are akin to Jim Crow laws is an exaggeration.
                            
                            And yet, many of the concerns expressed today about efforts to suppress voter turnout are based on an uncomfortable—and indisputable—historical reality. During most of the twentieth century, the right to vote was not uniform across racial groups because white political leaders in mostly southern states intentionally made it harder for Black people to vote. </p>
                            <br><br><br>
                            <p>Voter ID: A 2021 study published in Harvard’s Quarterly Journal of Economics analyzed ten years’ worth of elections to assess the impact of voter ID laws on voter turnout and election fraud. The authors found no negative impact on voter turnout, perhaps because the enactment of these laws mobilized campaigns to contact voters and inform them of the new requirements. Strict ID laws were found not to have any effect on turnout or registration for demographic groups based on their gender, race, age, or party affiliation. Further, these laws had no impact on actual or perceived voter fraud. 

                                No-Excuse Mail-In Voting: A Stanford University study analyzed the effects of no-excuse mail voting on turnout in the 2020 election. Turnout did increase in states that implemented this change in advance of the 2020 election, but no more than it did in other states. These results may seem counterintuitive given the record number of mail-in ballots cast due to concerns about COVID-19 spread. They also found that there was no partisan advantage to no-excuse absentee voting—while the number of Democrats who chose to vote by mail increased, this was offset by a decline in their rate of in-person voting. The authors concluded that voter interest and enthusiasm were considerably more predictive of voter turnout than the mechanics of how they vote.
                                
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>In the March 2021 Texas primary, state election officials rejected more than 18,000 mail ballots, 126% more than in previous elections. The rejection rate in majority-Democratic counties was significantly higher (15.1%) than that in majority-Republican counties (9.1%).

                                    VOTING TRENDS THROUGH 2020 
                                    
                                    Ultimately, it is still too early to tell whether the raft of state voting laws will change either overall turnout or turnout among various races, genders, or age groups. But a review of decades of data leading up to the 2020 election reveals that race was increasingly not the defining factor in determining who does and does not vote in America.</p>
